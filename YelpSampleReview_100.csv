1. The open kitchen so you can watch the quick moving -- and good looking -- chefs freshly prepare everything before your very eyes!
2. Bison tongue, Duck in a Can, and Sugar Pie. Nom, nom, nom!
3. Foie Gras Poutine, and prepared about 15 other ways
4. Amazing staff
5. Martin Picard running the kitchen in shorts and a Dickies shirt. 

In a word: Awesome.","review","KKucN3P6aH84MCfPr56a8g",1,3,3

Large coffee cups were very nice.  Enjoyed the fresh coffee.  I also liked the decor.  

Took forever for food to arrived.  It was very good, but portions are small.

I don't plan on going back again.","review","o3UxKDqQVZ_8mlO1eZ7JIg",0,0,0

The wifey ordered the Pad Kee Mow (beef) and it was excellent and the same as always. I ordered the red curry with beef and I got home to find the curry container half empty. I thought if it had plenty of veggies and beef that I wouldn't sweat it and we'd call it a day. However, there were about 3 tiny pieces of beef in my 1/2 order of curry and I wasn't pleased.

I called the restaurant to explain the problem and was told that they measured everything out and it was the correct amount. After telling them I'd ordered it at least 20 times before and it wasn't correct she insisted it was. Well, I guess we'll be headed back down the street to Panna Thai from now on.

Here's a big hint for the owners of restaurants. When a repeat customer calls and complains about an easily resolved issue you might want to try to make them happy otherwise they go to the competition which is what we'll be doing from now on.","review","_BL-KfyZqYruqDvxTY-vUg",1,2,2

But our company has had a few outings here. None of them were Siegfried and Roy though. But I did get to see that show once. I remember whispering to my boss, ""This can't end well in time."" Huh. I'm sorry but white tigers were not meant to live around tourists in Old Navy shorts and crappy flip flops.

Too often charming old buildings are paved over and replaces with concrete boxes.  The Cajun Queen is in one of these old homes, and this lends it a very intimate and warm atmosphere.

Of course, atmosphere isn't everything when it comes to restaurants, but the food at the Cajun Queen was fortunately spot-on as well.  Our tables started with the fried oyster appetizer, and it was a hit: emarkably light for a fried dish, it was like eating little oyster clouds.  For my main course, I ordered etouffee with all three (chicken, shrimp, and crawfish).  It was creamy and deeply, darkly spicy.  I was a little worried about the protein aspect, since those three items have different cooking times, but all were perfectly done.

The Cajun Queen provided us with a delicious dinner.  I knock a single star off only because the service, while not bad, wasn't great either.  The place isn't exactly cheap, so our waiter earned a nice tip.  He could've paid just slightly more attention to our table.  Oh well, everyone has an off day.","review","jTGQUWGIVvL-aY03C5BEmw",0,2,1

There weren't any other customers in the store when we walked in, but it was pretty late on a Sunday night. First thing I noticed was the lack of frozen yogurt options. They had a lot of machines but not a lot of flavors. So I looked around for the sample cups and to my disappointment I quickly realized this is one of those places that gets your samples for you. I HATE THAT!!! We will drive out of our way to avoid places like this. I don't know why it irritates me sooooo much, maybe it has something to do with the fact I'm a big girl, I can get my own sample of yogurt without making a mess. Careless folks ruin it for everyone I guess. 

The yogurt wasn't good. It was very soft, borderline runny. 

The toppings were lacking. If I wanted tons of candy, I would have been all set. But, since I wanted fruit, my options were limited. I could have strawberries, but they weren't fresh strawberries, it was like a chunky syrup. I could have cherries but I'd have to pick off all the stems, I could have pineapple...but I don't want pineapple, that sounds horrible on my half peanut butter, half cake batter yogurt. 

So despite my dad telling me I needed to get $6 worth, I just couldn't. 


I'm glad this place isn't by my house since I have no desire to come back. But, it is by my parent's house...guess I should check yelp for better options for them.","review","dUbYfSq6InzzAEjvlu9p6A",0,1,0

My group at work had a team lunch here (12) and I arrived early to alert the wait staff that we were apart of the ""separate check club."" Our lovely waitress gave me the look of death. She really didn't respond, so I wasn't sure if she actually heard me, so I repeated myself again. Sunshine cut me off and said ""I got it."" Ok, you got it? So you will bring 12 separate checks right? umm not so much. Sunshine brought one check and felt the need to make the comment ""we usually look down upon this."" 
Uncomfortable. 
To be nice, once again. I wrote everyone's name and the amount to charge them on the check, pretty easy right? Apparently not for Sunshine. I got the eye roll. For a split second I considered kicking her in the face, but with my boss sitting across the table from me, I didn't think it was wise. 
On the flip side, the food was really good. My pizza was delish, and the house salad dressing was so could, you can drink right from the bottle. Worth the try for sure. Just leave your pride and self esteem at the office.","review","ftdKj1p2Y0ABrr9uOPn97g",1,1,0

the line to get in is always long.  somehow my uncle always gets us in really quick.  he tells us to go straight up front. we've never had to wait longer than two minutes.  

service is good. the waiters/waitresses are super nice and check on you often, but not to where you feel you don't have privacy and it's bothersome.  

75% of what i grab is breakfast. i love breakfast! their omelets are the bomb.  their chinese food is pretty tasty too.  i load up on salad here. pasta is good.  super stringy cheesy pizza.  mmm yum.  i never pass on their gelato bar.  i grab several flavors at a time.  i just discovered their brownies. they have nice crisp edges and center is so moist.

I have seen a ton of these same types of shows in Vegas, and I left feeling like this one was very enjoyable. I liked everything about it really. Frankly I thought the girls looked fresher, had more energy and seemed like they were having a better time than some of the other showgirls that you know have been here in Vegas a long time. As far as their body types, I liked the fact that they all looked natural, I find that much more attractive than the overly siliconed type.

I thought the dancing was very good and I loved the girl that did the aerial ribbon and hula hoop stuff. Her balancing on the ""peg"" things was awesome! I think my favorite number was where 4 of the girls danced on the side of the stage, against the wall, then switched to the other side against the wall? Great description I know, lol, but it looked very sensual and sexy. 

The only negative I can probably agree with is there were a ton of empty seats which can feel a little weird, I guess. The theater is probably too big for this show and would feel more intimate in a smaller venue, but aside from that I had a great time :-)","review","_0kZCkjsGPc1JxOnJguTfA",0,4,1

Frankly, I am surprised by how comfortable the environment is here.  People seem to hang out for a long time.

One draw back is that the wait can be Disney long.  We went in a Monday afternoon at 3pm.  The wait was at least 30 min.  Cannot imagine what the line would be like at prime meal time or on weekends.

The lining system is interesting.  You use a kiosk to put your cell number and get a ticket that shows your wait time.  You will be texted when it is close to your turn.  Then you will stay in line, pay the cashier and be seated.

Since the wait can be long, go to the kiosk and grab a ticket early is important.","review","sIyHTizqAiGu12XMLX3N3g",3,3,3
"yYFoY20956m6rfFKDlCAsw","t9weY8vCyJ4GhDZFAHt03A",1,"2014-11-16","I've frequented both this location on Cactus, as well as the on on Scottsdale and Frank Lloyd Wright (Bell) since they both opened. Truth be told,  I've always preferred the Scottsdale location, and while the menu is the same, I've noticed the Scottsdale location was faster and more consistent in their food.  I'll NEVER set foot in here (Cactus) again, and here's why:  October 22, 2014, I went here with my 7 year old and my Mom. We arrived at 12:40, and by 12:45 we ordered. We watched another table get their food (who arrived after us), and so I asked what was the delay. The waiter said he'd ""go and check on it"", and by 1:20 we still didn't have our food, or an explanation.  (Keep in mind, the lunch rush was pretty much over that day,  as I counted two tables on the patio, and perhaps two more inside with customers still eating.) So, here I am with a hungry 7 year old and mother who's diabetic, and NEVER expecting to be waiting over 45 minutes at this point for food.   Ok. Things happen. Orders sometimes aren't entered in, I GET that.  I assumed someone either forgot to put in our order, or someone forgot to cook it, so I asked for some bread.  An easy request for an italian restaurant (or any restaurant for that matter). The waiter disappeared, and 10 minutes later, still no bread. I asked where it could be, and he said they needed to BAKE some.  What was inexcusable was that he was completely indifferent, not interested in correcting the terrible service, and the manager who came over was equally inept and unapologetic. My kid is awesome and patient, and so is my Mom.  I worked in restaurants many years of my life, and so I think I'm more forgiving than most but this was it.  We got up, walked out, and went over to Oregeno's across the street and proceeded to get top-rated service and food from these guys.  The reason Yelp is fabulous is you can have a head's up on what to expect at businesses. Just know what to expect here.","review","Zruvunhqw7cuyuoe7g09Gw",0,1,0

The first time was when my boyfriend took me and had set up their special romance package ahead of time. That includes a dozen roses, Champagne and two flute glasses, four-course Big Night Out® meal, picture in a pewter frame, private booth for two with curtains for $150.  Though I do not believe there were any roses and we did not get a picture in a pewter frame either. We did enjoy their cheese fondue (we chose the spinach and artichoke). Their wedge salad wasn't anything special. 
Our least favorite parts of the 4-course meal was the entrée. They give you 4-5 different meats that you cook for yourself in the pot if boiling water in the middle of your table. Each item cooks at different lengths, which my boyfriend disliked because the instructions were long and confusing. After we'd cooked all the meat and eaten we were very disappointed. There was hardly any flavor to it unless you dipped it in one of the 8 sauces they give you. 
The dessert was our favorite part of the meal, though we wouldn't go as far as to say it was phenomenal by any means. 
All in all this experience was not worth the price tag.
My most recent visit was for their ""Girls Night Out"" on Mondays. Food-wise the experience was the same but the price was better! And the best of all was their signature drinks. I would go back for their martini's, though they aren't strong they are delicious!","review","qhPbmsT1nEJK6yVezXeXLg",0,1,1

Then I finally get to the desk. Another 1 and half hour at the desk. That was ridiculous. I paid the upgrade fee for the car upgrade. However, they did not have the car I chose, Then the agent gave me a nicer VW car, which was fantastic. It made me feel it was worthy to wait for that long time. But, I found out the car charger did not work, both of then, on my way to Grand Canyon. My GPS died on the way and I had left from LV for like 1 hour already. I called the RS center and they told me I have to drive all the way back to LV airport. I said I had my plan and it would mess up my plan. They said I had no choice. Then it took another back to LV and another 30 mins to wait to change the car. They told me I couldn't get the kind of car what I got last night because I was just lucky last night. They were not nice and did not even apology for my time wasting. I understood they couldn't give me another premium car on the busy day. But it was unacceptable that they ignored the inconveniences that had made.

I chose another company for my following trip and they were much more nice and professional than this company. I will never choose this company again.

We had an amazing time the food and service was incredible. Eddy was our server and he was so awesome! So energetic, fun and knowledgeable. We started with the shellfish platter the flavor of all the seafood was all so good, so fresh so succulent mmmm... this honestly was so filling it would have satisfied us for dinner. Did we stop there though? Nope! next we got the Wagyu, I have never had Wagyu before and OMG!!! Now I know what I have been missing it was incredible!  It literally melts in your mouth! Honestly if you have an opportunity to order this, do it! You deserve to treat yourself! We all ordered a steak as well I got the 10 oz filet, medium rare with king crab Oscar topping. The steak was cooked so perfectly it honestly did not need the topping but the crab was very delish as well. All of our steaks were so perfect we all like medium rare but my brother in law ordered a bone in and Eddy our server suggested he ordered medium due to the bone it would come out a little more on the rare side if he were to go with medium rare. Eddy was on point with his suggestion. We also got the creamy Yukon potatoes, green beans and sweet corn pudding. We were so full with all the food and wine we were consuming! But we were having a blast and kept moving our bodies because the atmosphere was so fun they were playing the jams! A mix of 80's 90's and 00's, I have seen complaints of the noise level of the music and honestly I could hear what everyone in my table was saying and even our server.
Okay so we are singing along to our fave songs dancing while our plates are being removed from our table and we are so in the moment I did not notice they were laying out small plates in front of us we had a confused look on our face, what Is this for? And then Eddy brings out 2 shots for each of us and then they bring out desserts!! Omg!! Donuts with this glaze, whip cream and pecans! And a Panna cotta with strawberry topping! I think we all said at the same time ""Eddy! What are you doing to us!!"" Lol, We were so full how are we going to eat this! Well those 2 shots that were brought out,I am not sure what the first was I just drank it and the second was ginger beer, Eddy said this would help make us feel less full or something to that effect I had a lot of wine by now :) it must have worked because we dug right into the desert which was so incredible it was like a party in my mouth. 

Our whole time there we just were amazed with each bite, each sip, each song and each encounter we had with Eddy. We were headed to the club later that night so we had to run but I honestly did not want to leave and I had so much more fun at STK then I did at the night club. Thank you so much Eddy and STK for the amazing experience!!!!","review","QRXv7Jvq_SuiiT_SKvbdig",0,1,0

We have been frequenting this theater since it opened, for a number of reasons. They have the signature Harkins seats, which are comfortable rockers. Their prices are a little less expensive than AMC. This location is in a nice enough area that you don't feel scared walking across the parking lot at 10:30 PM after the show. They have very affordable child care (we've never used it) and it always looks like the kids are having fun in there. The snacks, like any theater, are waaaaaay overpriced, so we usually skip those. They have a loyalty drink cup that you can buy for $5 or so, and the refills are $1.50, so the cost is at least bearable. The bathrooms, both the normal and family ones, are always very clean. They have the summer movie program, which is a great deal at 10 movies for $7.

The food burger was cooked perfectly and juicy, this isn't McDonald's! The ingredients were all very fresh and it had a very good flavor. The french fries were good, some were overcooked, but I didn't care since the ""small"" order was damn near a pound of fries!

My tip centers around the wine selection. One of the partners is a private wine importer and has a good selection of natural wine, currently becoming very trendy in Paris. These hard to find, small producer wines go beyond just bio and include all facets of the production and vinification of wine. Can't find any of these in the SAQ, at least not intentionally.

My total bill was $200 when it should have only been $80 (this includes labor). After the repair was completed the manager told me that I needed to have another part replaced. When I acquired as to the cost of the procedure, he told me that it would be between $200 and $500 (including labor). After doing some checking around, I discovered that most mechanics would charge me between $80 and $100 for that same procedure. When I questioned the manager about my bill he became  irritated and defensive. He told me that he charged more for the belt, because all products and services come with a lifetime warranty. Yet, when I looked at the bottom of my billing statement it reads, ""Warranty on parts and labor is 90 DAYS unless otherwise specified. Warranty work has to be performed in our shop & cannot exceed the original cost of the repair..."" (Is it just me, or does something smell fishy here?)

them: you're the yelper...look up something.

dang...i hate being the only yelper in a group.  does that automatically make me a pro foodie or something?  i say not.  but after some phone yelping in our hotel room, i decided on the maple tree.  

it's on spring mountain road, so you really don't even need to get on the freeway.  and a side note: don't head north on the strip on a sunday at noon.  the traffic is awful.  go south and then west to the freeway.  if you don't get on the 15N at flamingo like i did, it should be less than a 20 min drive from the strip.  if you get on a tropicana, go north.  just trust me.  it'll make sense once you're there.    

anyhoo, once you past chinatown (okay, maybe not.....but there sure where lots of asian restaurants along the way) you'll see a strip mall on the right with the tiny little door for the maple tree.  the inside, which looks like a country grandma's kitchen/dining room, is larger than it looks from the outside, but still not huge.  we got lucky...no wait.

our resident gambler ordered the new england benny which i told him the reviews said they were known for.  it was delicious!  crab cakes on top of english muffins, topped with an egg and hollandaise sauce.  (yes, i know...three reviews in a row with hollandaise sauce.  it's just a coincidence, i swear.  this no yelping at work thing has really made me backed up on my reviews.)  

my french toast was just okay.  ever since i had the deliciousness at the gourmet pie co here at home, no other french toast has been able to compare.  with my girlfriend's chicken fried steak, the three of us ate for about $45.  

atmosphere is definitely family owned.  our gal was friendly and attentive.  i saw a couple locals come in alone with a book, greeting by name, enjoying their usual breakfast.  i hate eating on the strip.  it's crowded, more expensive and usually the food's not that good.  i found a local spot without having to call a cousin.  yay!","review","h4GmXUxM07MTOlMiGa0KuA",6,5,9

The most tempting items I purchased was a Huge Apple Strudel (10 inches long) for a little over $6. It was amazing! Some Polish sausage with a wonder smokey flavor that makes an amazing sandwich when paired with Sweet Hot pickles and a huge jar of Polish Plum Butter which I have a hard time finding even in a small jar.

Boyfriend wanted to do sushi and found this place that was on the way to the airport. Didn't think they would have good sushi places around here but surprise, surprise here's one! 

Pretty good selection of sushi and omg they have really good selection of desserts too - cheesecake, tiramisu, oreo mousse cake, chocolate cake - I was wowed by the choices of desserts because usually sushi on conveyor belt usually only have the mochi bread thing that I don't like and some jello thing - but this one had those and more. The sushi wasn't of superior quality - it is a conveyor belt one - they usually aren't but it's not the say that they are not good. As a matter of fact it's pretty decent quality in taste. 

They have things that I haven't had before either - like a whole lump of crabmeat (they claim is crab meat but it was 2 dollars -- so I don't know haha) mixed with some spicy mayo on a little dish. it was pretty good too. They also have a variety of different rolls - but I got pretty full after have 2 pieces of salmon and mackeral sushi, one salmon skin handroll, the lump of crabmeat and a piece of the spicy tuna roll and a piece of the tiramisu cake. Couldn't try more even if i wanted to.

The prices aren't too bad - starts out at $1.50 and the max was like 5 bucks.

But I will keep this place noted if there was a need for a quick sushi run the next time I am in Arizona.","review","hDHYbekIzW-M5tljy1IP1Q",1,0,0

Breakfasts, burgers, bowls, salads, juices, and smoothies are on the menu, with options to choose from one of PH's creations or make your own, which I prefer.  I've had a turkey bowl and a sirloin steak bowl, with either the quinoa or brown rice, adding mushrooms, tomatoes,or broccoli.

Andrew, the co-owner and the picture of muscle and fitness himself, has been there each time we've eaten there, manning the register and always checking on us after we get our orders.

Also, Diet Coke. Did not get left empty at all, not once. The service was pretty, pretty good. Aside from asking for napkins and not getting them AND the place being ice box cold, I'm just planning my next trip there. I'll bring my own napkins and just wear a coat next time!

There was one person taking names, another checking the names, two other standing their alternating taking the diners to their seats in the dated dining room. Christ the only reason we went to this place is because we had a gift card and I'm hoping the gift giver next year makes a better choice. So my wife ordered the fettucini alfredo with Chicken (she has a standard) and I ordered some sort of entre that appeals to men that only eat beef, toss it with some pasta and voila, Dinner!  The humorous moment was when the server asked me how I would like my braised beef done-it's braised, look it up. Anyhow the sauce with it was a cream base, had some portabella mushrooms with it and some fresh parsley (to make it appear fresh) though my entre looked like it has been sitting under the hot lights for a good 10 minutes. The salad we got was marginal (I don't get what the big deal is) and the breadsticks seemed like they'd been sitting in the basket for 10 minutes (not so hot)- While our food  wasn't absolutely horrible, I don't understand why this place is full all the time.

There are two park, one for the small stinkers (Dogs) and one for the big stinkers (Dogs).

There are people who get too fussy over their dogs playing with other dogs and try to protect them without understanding if the dogs are playing or fighting. Some dogs do not care to play while others will play rough like my stinker, but that is fine. There is one water fountain and nice large area to walk and let the dogs play.

Everything I've ordered here hit the mark; I've had the fried yucca root and choros a la chalaca (nice kick to it!) appetizers.  I can't get enough of the chicha morada (who would've thought a purple corn drink could be so delicous?).

As far as entrees, I've had a couple of the saltado dishes, and they were good, but never really my favorite Peruvian offerings.  The parihuela was good, although I wish you can get it in a half serving so you can have that and something else.  Most recently, I had the Pescado Contigo Peru, which was a fish filet with scallops and a few other things, served with a delicious spicy sauce and yucca root.  This is my favorite entree so far.

The flan is also respectable; it's a no-frills flan with a nice light flavor.  Not too overbearing.

If you haven't had Peruvian cuisine, this is a good place to see why a bunch of chefs ranked Peruvian cuisine as the second best world cuisine after French (citation needed).

A final note about the restaurant: they seem to have remodeled since my previous visit, and it's more welcoming inside now.  The portions are very generous - you will be filled, but you'll also pay $25-$30, depending on whether you get appetizers.

As we talk  the subject of Yard House henceforth referred to as Yardstick comes up. I have heard of this mythical place but as I live in Northern California and the ones in CA are in Southern California I had never been. A friend mentioned that Yardstick was in Scottsdale and I jump out of my seat and ask why I had wasted my whole vacation without going to this one.   My friend who also has a love of all things beer said that we should leave the fire and go. After extinguishing the fire (safety first kids). We were off.

I was impressed with the restaurant it was fairly new and had a big open feel to it. Their beer list also included 100+ choices.  Which brought a smile to my face. 

After removing all the beers I have had on the menu I was left with about 57 choices. I spent a few moments figuring out what I wanted. I went with a Dunkel. A good choice.

The rest of the night went well. I ordered a French Dip and it was pretty good. The rest of my beers were good too. Although a bit on the pricey side. 

One of my biggest problems was our waitress kept forgetting to place our orders for beer and since the place wasn't packed we had to wait longer for beers. If we weren't waiting for beers we were waiting to place orders for beers. After being told she had forgot to bring a round that was ordered she did give us two free beers which was nice.

I'd go back to Yardstick again simply because I like beer a lot and do like their selection.","review","UL3OMN_c-NXHlyb97pDifA",2,2,2

Many of the exhibits are geared toward little kids (10 and under).  Be warned, there is usually a TON of kids here.  And although this is a science center, it feels more like an advertisement for the local hospitals than a true science center.

The Forces of Nature exhibit is fantastic.  I was bummed out when it was closed for the Body Worlds exhibit.  

The planetarium is fun, I highly recommend it.

Great access to the light rail, which can be a fun addition (especially during the cooler months when you don't mind taking your time walking to and from the station).

I arrived to have dinner with Julia and Amy. I was exhausted and hungry. We were greeted and led into a HUGE dining room. I knew I was going to fall in love. Did I like the dumb dresses the ladies have to wear? No, but it makes the tourists and non-hispanic people feel comfortable. 
I usually set my bar on the quality of food based on the chips and salsa. We were served a fresh basket of chips and each given a personal bowl of salsa! Hooray for double dipping! The manager was walking around and he stopped by to say hello and then brought us a complimentary bowl of guacamole With three lovely ladies each with a fab pair...of.... I mean each with great personalities, what do you expect? So far so good! I had a margarita that was served in a martini glass full of ice... hmmm is that weird to anyone else? Oh well. The marg was good! 
For my entree I chose the enchiladas suizas with chicken. What I was served was definitely YUMMY! The tortillas were fresh and they were soft fried. Fabulous, authentic touch! The suizas sauce was slightly tangy. The tanginess was offset by the cotija cheese that was generously sprinkled on top. The word that came to mind every time I took a bite was ""creamy"". It was a very well made enchilada. The beans and rice were pretty good too. Here's my thing about re-fried beans. I like them when they're made with manteca (LARD) *GASP* and these were more than likely made with them. The re fried beans were flavorful. The rice was eh.. ok. It was rice. I sort of wished for a bit more spice in the rice, but again, it makes the tourists feel safe. 
An added bonus were the roaming musicians that they had. I was relieved to see that they were not in Mariachi suits but rather nice slacks and blazers and they were SINGING it. I wish I had more energy because I would have been whistling and doing a good ol Grita Mexicano along with the guys at the bar that were enjoying the entertainment!

If you love the music of Cash, Presley, Lewis and the under appreciated Perkins then you are going to love this show.  The show was fast paced and fun from beginning to end.  It really felt like the audience was a part of the moment.   The show is really about the owner of sun records Sam Phillips and how he single handed brought together this rag tag band of misfits and pulled their individual greatness out of all of them.  He saw some kind of light in them that nobody else did and he let that sun shine.  The break out performances here come from Marc Donovan who plays Sam Phillips and the actor who play Jerry Lee Lewis.  Donovan plays Phillips in a narrative role that controls the pace of the show.  He plays the part like a fatherly mentor that truly cares about the welfare of his ""children.""  You can really see the emotion that transcends the dollar signs when his children leave the nest.  Jerry lee Lewis is played like the child who needs to be put on Ritalin.  He is a hyperactive genius that can't contain himself. He is certainly the most fun to watch and I'm sure after playing two shows in row is ready to pass out by nights end.  The most amazing part of the show is the talent this cast has because they play their own instruments and most of them play extremely well.  Jerry lee Lewis and his piano work was unbelievable to watch.  Perkins guitar work was a real stand out. I loved it when he and Lewis would battle each other like two brothers trying to top one another in front of an onlooking parent. This show is a must see shooting under the radar out here in Vegas.

However, with that said...we just went for drinks.  It said to seat yourself so we did just that but then it took quite awhile to just get a damn menu. Then we ordered, and yes, it could be our fault for the choice...a Chianti.  It was just so-so.  The service was overly slow on all fronts....

We were seated immediately and the waitress promptly took our drink order. The manager presented each of us a small bite of the filet with a bit of bleu cheese dressing and some herbs. I'm not a fan of bleu cheese but it was delicious.

For starters, my wife ordered the crab-stuffed shrimp; I had the caesar salad. The shrimp was excellent, the salad was just a touch on the acidic side.

The bread basket contained three types of bread - one with some bacon inside (what's not to like about bacon!!!) accompanied by a plate of butter and some pesto dipping sauce - also very good.

Before our entrees arrived, the waitress served a sorbet ""palate cleanser"" - very nice touch.

We both ordered filet for the entrees and they were cooked perfectly. We also had potatoes and veggies; the potatoes were good - the veggies were great.

For dessert, we split the creme brulee (one order was enough for both of us) which came with strawberries, red raspberries and blackberries.

Other than the VERY MINOR salad error, we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly.

The chef came out and presented each dish that was prepared with the beer. Every course was delicious, plentiful, creative, and it was so obvious that the chef cared a lot about his work. 

We had:
-French fries with truffle oil ketchup (amazing!) and mayonnaise
-Chicken with potatoes served with a puree that was made with the carcass of the chicken. It was so rich and was reminiscent of a stew; it was very much comfort food but the presentation was elegant and interesting.
-Lamb served on top of herb spatzle. Fresh herbs had been cooked into the spatzle and then were also chopped and put on top.
-Apple struedel for dessert!

Every course was paired so thoughtfully with the beer and it was overall a great experience. I brought a few friends to Praying Monk and they loved it as well. The owner of Praying Monk is also very passionate about beer and was incredibly warm and kind. They definitely deserve your business!","review","xOlzK02DWzETeZ8HbiEB0A",0,2,2

The server found us after about 10 minutes, the cocktails were more like moonshine, and the spicy chicken curry (which we've had many times) was awful.  It was more like two cups of spicy seasoning was added instead of a proper amount.  The server didn't even offer to replace it for one of the guests who couldn't eat it.  My hubby (the spice lover) painfully choked it down.  The only reason I'm giving two stars for our last experience is for the ambiance and the Athens fries. We'll stick with W. Sahara.","review","y6sNNP97UCSl_p2o5Wm40A",1,0,0

It is the typical a la carte probably a bit over priced, but I had a fantastic dinner.  I did the bone-in ribeye, my girlfriend did the veal.  Both were amazing.  The atmosphere was pretty cool with the fires and tons of yuppy, suit-wearing drunk guys with grey hair.  

Overall we had a great time and will definitely be back.","review","4h8_u6Fqm3JvUEq8ctWf-A",0,0,0

This place is 24/7 and probably one of the only Korean options on the strip (everything else is arguably ""Asian fusion""). Big seating area so no wait at all. Service is pretty good also. 

We arrived in Vegas around 12am, so in reality 3am our biological clock time. Definitely a bit mentally disengaged from the party/gambling scene...just hoping to eat and rest up for a packed morning after. All the dishes here are above average; the soondubu was particularly soothing. LA Galbi and pajeon were just right and helped fill our stomachs after a starving travel. The three dishes came out to around $50-60. Not bad

Highly recommended should this place be your after-flight (and night? dare i say) cure","review","65_YeaivbdWNk1ZHiAI77w",0,0,0

The menu is super cute and there is a large variety!  I have the Southwest Chicken salad, which was a bit spicy for me but uber good!  Many other salad and sandwiches looked great too. 

Only reason this place doesn't get the full 5 stars from me is the parking is a bit limited, and there are only a few tables.  I know, no fault of the restaurant but for a person who likes easy access, parking is a big deal for me.","review","AaKlegu7gmOCD4rEESF76Q",2,3,2
